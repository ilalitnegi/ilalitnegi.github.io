Research Scientist specializing in the development of cutting-edge [simulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation) and signaling systems, dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of software development, specializing in C++ and Qt to create cutting-edge Simulator. My fascination with technology extends beyond coding. I am deeply interested in the realm of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, where I believe the future holds limitless possibilities. My goal is to harness the power of data to drive informed decisions and solve complex problems. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in Data and Healthcare security. In today's digital age, safeguarding sensitive medical data is paramount. I am committed to exploring ways to enhance security measures within the healthcare sector, ensuring that critical information remains protected. I am always open to networking and collaborating with like-minded professionals who share a passion for technology, data, and healthcare security. Let's connect and explore opportunities to make a meaningful impact together.

Projects
======
<li>  iCBTC: [i-CBTC](https://www.metrorailnews.in/icbtc-helping-towards-unmanned-train-operations/) is an indigenous communication-based train control system (i CBTC), which is being developed in India for the first time, shall enable unmanned metro and train operations. Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is an advanced railway signaling system that relies on telecommunications for communication between trains and trackside equipment to manage traffic and control railway infrastructure. CBTC offers a highly precise means of determining a train's exact position, surpassing the accuracy of traditional signaling systems. This results in a more efficient and safer approach to overseeing railway traffic. Metros and other train systems can expand their capacity while upholding or even improving safety. CBTC is classified as a continuous and automatic train control (ATC) system. 

Within the framework of the project, I undertook a variety of responsibilities and tasks that included the following:
 <ul>• Developing the train simulator for ATC</ul> 
 <ul>• Developed a GUI based application for interacting with hardware loggers</ul>
</li>
<!-- It achieves this through several key features, including the use of high-resolution train location determination that doesn't rely on track circuits, continuous bidirectional data communication between trains and wayside equipment, and the presence of onboard and wayside processors capable of executing automatic train protection (ATP) functions. Additionally, it offers optional features such as automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) services, all as defined in the IEEE 1474 standard. In modern CBTC systems, trains consistently calculate and transmit their status to trackside devices distributed along the railway line through radio communication. This status report includes crucial information such as the precise train location, speed, travel direction, and braking capabilities. This dataset serves a vital purpose: it allows for the calculation of the potential area a train could occupy on the track. Furthermore, it empowers trackside equipment to identify specific locations on the railway that must never be crossed by other trains sharing the same track. These critical points are communicated to trains, enabling them to autonomously and continuously adjust their speed while adhering to safety and comfort standards, including minimizing jerk. Consequently, trains continually receive distance information from the train ahead of them, enabling them to dynamically adapt their safety separation distance.-->



<li>  RSDTS: The [RSDTS](https://www.metrorailnews.in/dmrc-in-collaboration-with-bharat-electronics-launched-the-prototype-of-indigenous-rolling-stock-driver-training-system-rsdts/), or Indigenous Rolling Stock Driver Training System, represents a significant achievement as the first domestically developed universal train driving simulator that can be readily adapted for various metro or railway systems. The RSDTS (Indigenous Rolling Stock Driver Training System) will also serve the purpose of assessing the driving proficiency of active Train Operators, a crucial safety requirement that is conducted periodically. This represents a groundbreaking development as the first universally adaptable train driving simulator developed domestically, capable of being customized to suit any Metro or Railway system. The indigenously developed RSDTS introduces a unique feature wherein the same core software can be employed to configure different combinations of rolling stock, signaling systems, and line profiles. 
  
In the context of the project, my role encompassed a following range of responsibilities and tasks:
 <ul type = "square">• Developed the simulation engine, Signaling system, Automatic Decision System (ADS)</ul>
 <ul>• Simulated the real based malfunction of the train in the system using the malfunction handler module</ul>
 <ul>• Featured with the training assessment and evaluation module for examining the train operator during training</ul> 
 <ul>• Coordination among Sensor Integration, Display, Database development team and DMRC Project executives for design change introduction in development line as 
        per time-plan</ul> 
</li>
<!-- This can be achieved simply by altering the input data files, with minimal adjustments to the driving desk hardware if necessary. Consequently, this enhances the training system's adaptability and results in significant cost savings for Delhi Metro, as a single system can now be employed for multiple rolling stock types and various routes.  In contrast, the equipment previously acquired by DMRC was imported from Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers at a considerable expense. Furthermore, the designs presently in DMRC's possession are specifically tailored for a single type of rolling stock and are limited to the initial design stage in terms of accommodating different line profiles and signaling systems. Officials have stated that making alterations at a later stage is a complex and cost-prohibitive endeavor.-->


<li> IACCS: The [IACCS](https://www.indrastra.com/2015/09/ANALYSIS-IACCS-257.html) is an Integrated Air Command and Control System, automated command and control system designed to oversee and manage air defense operations conducted by the Indian Air Force. Operating over an extensive IP-based wide area network, this C4I (Command, Computer, Control, Communication, and Intelligence) system facilitates the comprehensive monitoring and control of air operations.  The IACCS system collects data from various types of radar systems, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous (2-D or 3-D), generates reports from mobile observation posts, and consolidates data from different sources, such as Air Force Airbases and civilian agencies like Air Traffic Control and the Air Force Movement Liaison Unit. This also includes data from airborne platforms like AWACS. All this data is integrated in real-time to create a comprehensive Recognized Air Situation Picture (RASP) at the IACCS Command and Control Centre (C&C Centre). The connectivity between sensors and agencies to and from the IACCS C&C Centre is established through a wide area network based on the IP protocol. 

My involvement in the project encompassed a diverse set of responsibilities and tasks, which are outlined as follows:
 <ul>• Developed GUI based weapon simulator for Indian Air Force</ul>
 <ul>• Simulated 100+ sending messages and 50+ receiving messages for each type of missile system</ul>
 <ul>• Configured each missile system with the default data using easy manageable XML files</ul>
 <ul>• Featured with message logger system, converting the sending data to hex and hex to decimal</ul> 
 <ul>• Developed the commonlibrary using the netbeans IDE</ul> 
 <ul>• Easily modifiable for the new missile systems</ul> 
 </li>
<!-- It enables uninterrupted and integrated air operations throughout the entire airspace of the country, covering the Area of Responsibility (AOR) for the nation. IACCS serves as an automated Command and Control center for the Air Force, responsible for the control and surveillance of Air Operations. In the era of network-centric warfare, having access to a Recognized Air Situation Picture (RASP) is of paramount importance. This information needs to be available at different levels to facilitate a series of tactical decisions. These levels include the strategic level (Air Headquarters), operational level (Command Headquarters), and tactical level (Divisional level). Information sharing entails the exchange of critical data through dedicated links among the Navy, Army, and Civil Radar networks.-->
