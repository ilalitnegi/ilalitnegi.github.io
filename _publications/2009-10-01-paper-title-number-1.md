collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Nowadays mobile phone becoming one of the most popular communication system. Information shared through this medium is a very sensitive to the users. Hence it is highly needed to secure the message from the intruders. This paper proposed an android based secured system named Steg! developed by combining the cryptography and steganography. Here the algorithm used for cryptography is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Least Significant Bit is used for the steganography. This hybrid approach increases the level of secretion of information from unauthorized the access by encrypting the message and hiding into the image. The application helps the user to hide/unhide the text to/from the image. The proposed system above is proven to be powerful and robust than those system which implements cryptography and steganography alone'
