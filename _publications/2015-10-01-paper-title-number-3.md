excerpt: 'With the advancement of technology, the chances of stealing the data are also increasing day by day. So, it’s important to protect the data from the attackers. To complete this task, we use a technique, called Cryptography. Cryptography is the technique of transforming the meaningful data into the unintelligible data so that attacker cannot get the idea about the original data from the unintelligible data. In India, today most people communicate in Hindi Language and also keep their confidential information in Hindi. So, it’s important to have a cryptographic technique which works on Hindi. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid technique to encrypt or decrypt the data which is in Hindi Language. This hybrid technique uses two different cryptographic techniques: Double Transposition and Elgamal.'
