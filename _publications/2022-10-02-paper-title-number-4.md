title: "Overview of Security approaches using Metamorphic Cryptography"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Initially, researchers employed only one information security technique either cryptography or steganography to secure the communication. But later, researchers stress on the amalgamation of both cryptography and steganography, and this amalgamation is popularly known as metamorphic cryptography. Steganography can be classified on the basis of cover medium. This paper surveys the different metamorphic cryptography approaches which uses image as cover media for securing the data. This paper also covers general concepts of cryptography, steganography, classification of metamorphic cryptography, and evaluation parameters like PSNR, MSE.'
